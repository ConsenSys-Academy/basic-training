    <h1>Text-Based Editors</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      Up till this point, we've only talked about visual code editors. But there
      is also the option of text-only editors. If you're taking this course, you
      may feel like text-only editors are totally out of reach and not
      interesting. That's totally understandable! However, it's good to know a
      little bit about text-only editors, in case you encounter one in some sort
      emergency. Unclear what that emergency would be, but stick with us here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many developers find text-based editors to be extremely productive and,
      while challenging to learn, make their job much easier. For many folks,
      the idea of not using a mouse is terrifying. But, as
      <a
        href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/"
        target="_blank"
        >one article</a
      >
      points out, "Your mouse is a bit like an implant a doctor would have put
      on your body at a very young age, telling your parent that it’s the best
      device to do something on a computer. You like it because you’re deeply
      used to it." (Read the section "The Mouse: Your False Best Friend" in
      <a
        href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/"
        target="_blank"
        >this article here</a
      >)
    </p>

    <p>
      The concise argument for text-based editors is this: Keyboards are quicker
      and more intuitive than mouses. Since text-based editors rely
      predominantly on keyboards, developers find them extremely productive and,
      while challenging to learn, make their job much easier. Also, vim is
      installed in almost every operating system, so if you need an editor in a
      pinch, you know you can almost always open a file from the command line
      with <code>$ vim [file-name]</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're remotely curious, go through some of the tutorials provided
      here. Then, if you're stuck having to edit a file on the command line, try
      to do a <i>few</i> edits and save them. We're providing resources for
      <code>vim</code> here because we found the best resources for it. We'll
      link to those right after explaining something everyone should know just
      in case:

      We can hear you on the other end of the screen saying, "Well, I don't need
      to know this because I'll never be caught dead in vim! That's exactly how
      you get into a mess like this, buddy. No one plans to be stuck in Vim and
      one does not simply exit vim.

      Short answer: If you find yourself in a vim editor somehow, freeze. Do not
      touch anything except for <code>:q</code>. Vim works in a series of modes,
      and if you find yourself in a mode, try to hit the ESC key, then press
      <code>:q</code>, don't forget the colon! If somehow you've made edits in
      vim but want to leave, you must quit with <code>:wq</code>, which stands
      for <b>w</b>rite these changes and <b>q</b>uit.
