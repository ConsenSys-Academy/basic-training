    <p>Whereas the command line is great for one-off lines and quick workflow, the code editor is where people build larger programs and projects. We'll be focussing on GUI code editors, also called "visual" or "desktop" code editors. Visual code editors are much more approachable than the command line to many coming from a non-technical background.</p>

    <p>At the most basic, a code editor is a place where you can write and edit all different kinds of code. However, today, code editors can be customized and enhanced to not only help you write code but also manage all the tasks <i>around</i> writing, maintaining and deploying code. </p>

    <p>In fact, the most popular visual code editors today do so much more than write code, they may even be considered an Integrated Development Environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">IDE</a>). With an editor like VSCode, for example, you can spin up a server, use Github, run a command line or debug a particular file. The capacity is quite impressive.</p>

    <p>We'll be walking through <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a> in this module, since it's free, runs on Windows, Linux and Mac, and has a large number of extensions. However, there are so many great code editors out there, including <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom,</a> <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text,</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IDEA</a> (written originally for Java but now supporting many languages). If you're working with Python, a popular IDE which also functions as a visual editor, is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm.</a></p>
