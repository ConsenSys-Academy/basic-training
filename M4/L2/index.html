      is developed by Microsoft and, since the mid 2010s, has become a dominant
      visual code editor. It is

        >Electron-based</a
      >
      and can run on Windows, Mac or Linux. It also is open-source with a
      rigorous development cycle and has a large number of plug-ins, known as
      extensions. It also has become extremely popular, so software companies
      like Docker and ConsenSys will build their own VSCode extensions which you
      can download for free from
      <a

      You can install VSCode on Windows, Mac or Linux

    <p>
      VSCode is a good editor to learn to code on because these extensions can
      help with the learning process. In this section, we're going to point out
      a few benefits that VSCode ships with.

    <h2>Native Features</h2>


    <p>
      Here are a few features that ship with VSCode you can start using
      immediately:

          target="_blank"
         
          ><b>Emmet Language</b></a
        >
        is a tool that allows for high-speed develompent of HTML, CSS and other
        structured languages. VSCode supports Emmet out of the box, you can read
        more about

          ><b>Scrollbar Navigation</b></a
        >
        Sometimes you can be dealing with a large codebase. On a single monitor,
        there isn't a lot of real estate and it can be hard to find your place.
        VSCode's navigation bar has some helpful features:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In "Bar Mode," (the standard scrollbar), VSCode can annotate where
            your cursor is, where you've made changes, instances of a search
            term or other markers.
            <a
              href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-track-your-code-by-customizing-the-scrollbar?view=vs-2019#annotations"
              target="_blank"
             
              >Read about the scroll bar here.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            In "Map Mode," the scrollbar shows a small version of the entire
            code. You can adjust how wide the scrollbar is and you can enable a
            larger preview that opens when you hover. You can also scroll using
            the map mode scrollbar just as you do a regular scrollbar. Read more
            about map mode

          ><b>Split pane</b></a
        >
        Another way to navigate a long file or easily toggle between related
        files is to use side-by-side editing. VSCode allows you to split the
        editor horizontally or vertically any number of times. You can move
        files between the panes depending on what you need to see! Read more

          ><b>Multiple Cursors</b></a
        >
        If you need to edit something exactly the same in multiple places,
        VSCode allows you to use create multiple cursors which will all follow
        your keyboard commands. For more information about multiple cursors (and
        multiple selections),

          target="_blank"
         
          ><b>Opening a Terminal</b></a
        >
        VSCode incorporates your computer's terminal in its application. You can
        open the terminal, which is opened in the current directory, by pressing
        CTRL + `, or navigating in the menu to "Terminal > New Terminal"

          target="_blank"
         
          >Launching From Command Line</a
        >
        Another nice trick of VSCode is launching in directly from your own
        command line. Once you've configured your machine properly, you can
        navigate to a folder in your computer you'd like to work in and simply
        run <code>code .</code>. This will open VSCode and load the directory
        and all its children. Read more about setting this up
