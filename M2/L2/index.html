  <h1>Package Managers</h1>
  <h2>What are they?</h2>
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>The operating system, be it Unix or Linux, is the very basic software needed to run a computer. But we'd like to do more interesting things than just type or use the basic software, right? This is where package managers come in.</p>

    <p>Package managers "automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer [software] for a computer's operating system" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager" target="_blank">source</a>). Installing software involves a host whole of operations, including finding the proper source, making sure the computer can run the software, creating directories for the software to store information, keeping the software up to date, and, if desired, removing the software completely from the computer.</p>

    <p>Linux's package manager <code>APT</code> is good and we'll learn about it below, but MacOS' does not have a native package manager installed. We'll go over how to install a third-party package manager for Mac called Homebrew.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Package Tool (APT)</h2>

  <p>Since Linux is open-source, it has a free package manager called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)" target="_blank">APT</a> better recognized from its common command <code>apt-get</code>.</p> 

  <p>Since it is shipped natively with Linux, you do not have to install it. If you would like to learn more about APT, you can read about it on Ubuntu.com <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

  <p>The command line section is next, but a preview here: To run APT on your machine, you typically have to use the <code>sudo</code> command. To learn more about sudo, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo" target="_blank" >please see here.</a></p>

  <h2>Mac's Package Manager: Homebrew</h2>

  <p>As mentioned above, MacOS does not come with a native package manager. If you're not comfortable with the command line yet, please go through the next module and install Homebrew when you're comfortable.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> is a popular, open-source package manager for MacOS and Linux, but it's mainly used on MacOS. Homebrew is written in Ruby and can be installed from the command line. You can either visit <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">the Homebrew website</a> or simply paste this into your terminal:</p> 

  <pre style="word-wrap: break-word;">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre>

  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation" target="_blank">the Installation page</a> from Homebrew</p>
