    <h1>Unix / Linux Environment</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->
    <p>To be successful in this course you must have access to a Unix or Linux based operating system. MacOS is based on
      Unix and if you're running Ubuntu, that's a Linux distribution.</p>

    <b>If you are on a Windows 10 machine, <a
        href="https://consensys.net/blog/developers/ethereum-developers-guide-to-setting-up-windows-subsystem-for-linux/"
        target="_blank">follow this guide to installing a Linux environment on Windows</a> before starting the
      course.</b>

    <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank">Unix</a> is an operating system developed in the
      1970s at the famous AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ, USA. It was written to make computer development
      easier for individuals and teams. It was enormously successful and influenced the development of a whole family of
      languages classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like" target="_blank">"Unix-like."</a> These
      include the operating systems for Apple computers (MacOS) and Android (Linux).</p>

    <p>Unix-like languages provide a common framework for developers to learn and share. As a result, we need every
      student to have access to either a MacOS system, a Linux system, or a Windows 10 machine (we can install Linux on
      a Windows 10 machine following <a
        href="https://consensys.net/blog/developers/ethereum-developers-guide-to-setting-up-windows-subsystem-for-linux/"
        target="_blank">this tutorial</a>).</p>

    <h2>How to Install It</h2>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>Until recently, Windows has been a hard operating system to learn software development. However, with Windows 10,
      users can now have access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux"
        target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>. This has dramatically changed the experience of Windows
      users in this course, for the better!</p>

    <p>Before starting the course, be sure to install WSL on your Windows machine, using <a
        href="https://consensys.net/blog/developers/ethereum-developers-guide-to-setting-up-windows-subsystem-for-linux/"
        target="_blank">this tutorial.</a> When we install VSCode later, be sure to make sure the VSCode software
      integrates with WSL <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl" target="_blank">(follow this tutorial
        here)</a>.</p>

    <h3>Mac</h3>
    <p>If you are on a Mac operating system, do not worry about installing Linux. The Mac operating system is <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like" target="_blank">"Unix-like"</a> and will do just fine for the
      course!</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>If you'd like to learn more about the development of Unix and its enormous impact on modern computing, you can
      watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0" target="_blank">this archive video</a> from Bell Labs
      introducing Unix to the world.</p> You can also read <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/book/02-unix.pdf"
