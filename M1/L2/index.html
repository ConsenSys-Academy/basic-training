  <h1>Learn How to Ask a Question</h1>
  <h2>A surprisingly challenging task</h2>
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>One of the most critical tools you will <i>ever</i> develop as a human being is the ability to formulate a question about a problem you're having. Many people incorrectly assume that the  most valuable piece of information to a question is its answer. Even more valuable in the long-term is the path taken to find the answer. If you can figure out that path, you not only solve your current problem,you also guarantee a better outcome for any problems you will encounter in the future</p>

    <p>When learning programming, formulating a question about your problem is especially helpful due to the massive amount of software knowledge, advice, forums, tutorials, and repositories indexed online. This is not true for every question, of course, but you can get pretty far on your own with a few well-placed search terms.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, we're going to discuss two aspects of asking a question:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>How to properly Google a problem</li>
      <li>Once you've exhausted that option, how to formulate your question to someone else</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Google</h2>
    <p>A lot of people just starting in programming don't fully recognize how much Googling even the most senior developers do <i>every day</i> in their jobs. No one can remember everything, particularly with the rapid pace of development. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65918/importance-of-learning-to-google-efficiently-for-a-programmer" target="_blank">As one commenter on Stackoverflow said:</a></p>

    <blockquote>I would rather be more knowledgeable at searching in general than knowledgeable about what I am searching for. If I am more efficient at searching, I can find anything. If I am more knowledgeable about a single subject, I am only good at searching within that subject.</blockquote>

    <p>This cannot be emphasized enough. Senior engineers often use search engines to find answers to their software questions. If senior devs do it, why wouldn't you?</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for using Google effectively to find an answer to your problem:</p>

    <h3>The error message is your friend</h3>
    <p>When you hit a snag, almost always you'll get an error message. The error message is your ticket to success. Sometimes you can get an answer just pasting an error message into a search engine.</p>
    
    <p>Most likely, you'll have to alter it a little bit. Take the error message below, which we get while using an Ethereum software tool called <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/" target="_blank">Truffle:</a></p>

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-1.png" alt="A command line displaying an error from the Ethereum framework Truffle" srcset=""></div>

    <p>This error has occurred because there is no port specified in the configuration file (don't worry if none of those words make sense). We don't know that yet, all we know is we have an error message.</p>

    <p>The first line of error says, <pre>Something went wrong while attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</pre> First, we want to remove generic terms. This will help narrow the search. Let's remove <pre>Something went wrong while</pre> which leaves us with <pre>attempting to connect to the network. Check your network configuration.</pre> Let's stick with the last sentence <pre>Check your network configuration</pre>, as it's something we're being asked to check.</p>

    <p>Second, we're going to want to add to our search whatever piece of software or library we're using, to further narrow down our problem. So our search is <code>Truffle check your network configuration</code>.</p> Here's my results page:

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-2.png" alt="First page of search results for 'truffle check your network configuration'"></div>

    <p>The first site looks promising, as its Truffle softwares <i>documentation page.</i> A project's documentation page contains any and all known aspects of the project. When we click on that link, we get:</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/truffle-error-3.png" alt="Truffle configuration page with the answer to our problem circled in red"></div>

    <p>Circled in red is an example of a perfect network configuration. If we check it against our misbehaving code, we will find our error.</p>

    <p>Note: all major browsers have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools" target="_blank">developer tools,</a> which include a console for error messages. If you're working on a website, that's a great place to find errors.</p>

    <p>This process is not necessarily intuitive and may take some time to learn. But after a while, you will develop a sense of the best words to use to search to get the best results. You'll also start to recognize websites that seem well-structured and informative.</p>

    <p>Most despairingly, typically solving one problem will lead to another problem surfacing. Take a deep breath and repeat the process on <i>that</i> problem. But be sure to remember the issues as they arise. The knowledge you gain from solving one problem on a project stands to benefit any future problems.</p>


    <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>

    <p>The generous and benevolent gods of the internet have given software developers a great gift. That is the elitist, snarky but nonetheless extremely smart community on the website Stack Overflow (sometimes abbreviated SO).</p>

    <p>A lot of journeys of software troubleshooting will end at Stack Overflow, but sometimes it might even be helpful to start your search within Stack Overflow itself. Regardless, you will become very familiar with this site.</p>

    <p>At times, all the searching in the world doesn't get you the answers you need. Sometimes you're not getting the expected behavior from your computer, but there are no error messages, just your frustrated face. At that point, you need to ask someone for help. We'll show you the best way to do that in the context of programming.</p>

     <!--Begin 'Check Date section'-->

     <h4 style="color: red"> Important Note: </h4>
     <p>When dealing with blockchain technologies, it is important to note that they are always changing, resulting in tutorials and code forums becoming outdated quickly. It is crucial that you check the publish date and main libraries used on tutorials and code forums to mitigate errors or bugs in your code. </p>

    <h3>How to Ask Someone For Help</h3>

    <p>The first thing to know about how to ask someone for help is <i>when</i> to ask someone for help. If you're totally lost, absolutely reach out for help. However, you should take some time and basic effort of deducing the problem on your own before coming to someone else for help. We do this for two reasons: First, you want to be respectful of people's time. You should follow the steps above to search around on the internet, then you can let the person know what you've found. Second, if you haven't done the basic Googling, that's exactly what the person you're reaching out to is going to do. Many people believe mentors or instructors wouldn't stoop to use a search engine but, spoiler alert, it's one of the most powerful tools. So rather than feeling dependent on someone else to do something well within your capacity, you should empower yourself to do the basic sleuthing first.</p>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>This cannot be stressed enough: <b>Context is an absolute, ultimate, don't-even-ask-unless-you-have-it requirement for asking a question.</b> Since we are all virtual, no one can see your setup or be able to look at your computer themselves. As a result, we don't know what led you to have your problem. Also, people in different timezones might have an answer but won't be able to ask if you're already offline.</p>
    
    <p>Since context is so important, we've provided a template that you <b>MUST</b> use when you are asking a question in the course. Seriously, we're going to make you fill this out if you don't use this template! We'll explain why after we go through it.</p>

    <h5>Template for Questions</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>My question is: 
        <ul>
          <li>Related to something technical I'm struggling with</li>
          <li>A concept I don't understand</li>
          <li>A question about logistics in the course (quizzes, grading, final project submission)</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <p>For technical questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is your computer environment:
            <ul>
              <li>What OS version are you running? (Name and release version, i.e. MacOS Big Sur, Ubuntu 20.04)</li>
              <li>If you're asking a question about a specific piece of software or library, what version are you running? Typically, in desktop software, this is found in the "File > About" dropdown menu or, for command line software, by running <code>[PROGRAM-NAME] --version</code> or <code>[PROGRAM-NAME] -v</code></li>
              <li>If you're using npm, what version are you running? use <code>npm -v</code> to find out.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What is your issue:
            <ul>
              <li>Describe your problem in general terms.</li>
              <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
              <li>What actually happened? Please give examples and provide screenshots of the error. Please copy the error message and provide it when asking the question. </li>
              <li>Please provide the shortest amount of steps to reproduce your issue.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Steps already taken:
            <ul>
              <li>What have you tried already?</li>
              <li>Any promising Google or Stack Overflow results?</li>
              <li>What do you think the problem might be?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>For questions about concepts you don't understand:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the concept you have a question about? Is it in the course, if so, which module or lesson?</li>
          <li>What about this concept <b>do</b> you understand? Are there concepts related to it that you do understand?</li>
          <li>What about this concept <b>don't</b> you understand?</li>
          <li>Using specific keywords, have you searched online or in the Discord chat?</li>
          <li>Please link to any relevant documents. If you're asking about something not in the course, please provide a link related to the concept.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>For questions about logistics in the course:</p>  
        <ul>
          <li>What module / lesson are you having trouble with?</li>
          <li>Describe your problem in general terms.</li>
          <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
          <li>What actually happened?</li>
          <li>What have you tried already?</li>
          <li>What do you think the problem might be?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>While it may seem burdensome to fill out this template, it ensures two things. First, it helps you understand the nature of the problem you're asking about. Sometimes doing that can help us solve our own problems. Second, it provides the valuable context we mentioned above. This increases our chances of finding an answer as it reduces the amount of time and effort needed to understand the basics of the situation. And it provides an asynchronous way of someone else understanding your problem so they can still try to help even if you're not online.</p>
