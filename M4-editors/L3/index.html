    <h1>VSCode Extensions</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      One of the reasons we're using VSCode is its extensive library of
      extensions. These are software add-ons developed by an open community to
      assist with certain aspects of the developer workflow. You can find VSCode
      extensions in the
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode"
        target="_blank"
        >VSCode Marketplace.</a
      >
      There are thousands of extensions, but not all of them are helpful or
      appropriate for someone just getting started. Here are the ones we'd
      recommend you install, broken into categories:
    </p>


    <h2>Critical for Beginners</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/"
          target="_blank"
          >Live Share</a
        >
        an easy way to share your code with someone for pair programming. You
        need to have a Github account to register, but you need one for Bootcamp
        anyway! This is great because, if you're having issues with some code or
        even install certain libraries, you can connect with a mentor or fellow
        student extremely quickly and easily.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcsine.chronicler"
          target="_blank"
          >Chronicler</a
        >
        A screen recorder for VSCode. This is also extremely helpful for getting
        help. If you're doing something on VSCode and having issues, but can't
        connect with anyone realtime, use Chronicler to record what is going
        wrong in VSCode. It requires some additional software, but it guides you
        through the download process. There's also the option of recording
        audio, which would help build context for anyone hoping to help you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Development (Intermediate)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"
          target="_blank"
          >Live Server</a
        >
        which allows you to easily start a server in the directory. It creates a
        "hot reload" server, which immediately reflects any changes once you
        save it in the project directory.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens"
          target="_blank"
          >Gitlens</a
        >
        "supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code." Adds
        significantly more capacity for Git in VSCode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryu1kn.partial-diff"
          target="_blank"
          >Partial Diff</a
        >
        Compare (diff) text selections within a file, across files, or to the
        clipboard
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"
          target="_blank"
          >Markdown All in One</a
        >
        All you need to write Markdown
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gimenete.github-linker"
          target="_blank"
          >Github Linker</a
        >
        Create links to fragments of code in GitHub
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Blockchain Development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.solidity-visual-auditor"
          target="_blank"
          >Solidity Visual Developer</a
        >
        Built by ConsenSys!
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity"
          target="_blank"
          >Solidity linter</a
        >
        Checks valid Solidity syntax. Fair warning, can be over-opinionated for
        folks!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>VSCode Color Themes</h1>
    <p>
      Similar to the terminal color themes, VSCode allows for easy installment
      of a number of color schemes. Again, the goal is to reduce eyestrain,
      improve readability, catch syntax errors, and look cool! Here are three
      popular color themes for VSCode:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Dracula</b></a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Night Owl</b></a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Oceanic Next</b></a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Again, we're just skimming the surface here, for both extensions and
      themes. Poke around and see what you find!
