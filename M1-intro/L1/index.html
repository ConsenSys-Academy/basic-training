    <p>
      Starting to teach yourself programming can be difficult because there are
      a lot of small things you learn on the way to bigger things. A basic
      programming blog post assumes a non-trivial amount of existing knowledge.
      Sometimes, successfully completing the first step of a tutorial will
      require hundreds of tiny initial steps beforehand.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not just online material, even university courses at elite
      institutions don't teach fundamental skills. We know this because MIT's
      Computer Science department has a course called
      <a target="_blank" href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/"
        >"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education."</a
      >
      (we'll cite this often!)
    </p>

    <p>
      This not only makes starting to learn programming hard, it can also
      lead to people to use fundamental tools poorly. If we are taught a task
      only to accomplish another task, we'll typically only learn the minimum
      effort that gets us to the second. This can often result in a tutorial
      spiral where you end up completing X without digesting the fundamentals.
      We are often taught the command line "good enough" to accomplish the job,
      but not necessarily best practices. This often results in disaster!
      We can then end up compounding the problem by continuing to use these
      essential tools in inefficient and sometimes agonizing ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      We built this mini-course to give a space to learn these fundamental tools
      in a deliberate, focused way. We saw many people signing up for our
      Blockchain Frontend Bootcamp, having to learn the fundamentals while also
      learning frontend development, along with blockchain skills. This course
      hopes to pre-emptively help with many of the issues we've seen people
      struggle with over the years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if you're very familiar with the technology in these lessons, we
      encourage you to flip through them. Along with introductory material,
      weâ€™ve curated tips and tricks for optimizing and improving your use of
      these tools. After all, if you're staring at a code editor for hours,
      shouldn't it be tricked out in the best way possible? Who knows, what you
      learn here could make your developer experience not only more efficient,
      but fun!
    </p>

    <h2>A Few Things</h2>

    <p>
      Luckily, to get comfortable you don't need to know that many things. It's
      just that they don't typically get explained together all at once.
    </p>

    <p>In this mini-course, we're going to go through five topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unix / Linux Operating Systems</li>
      <li>Command Line</li>
      <li>Code Editor</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Javascript / Node / Web Frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We will provide some material in these lessons, but we'll mainly be
      providing links to <i>other</i> places where you can learn more. If you
      never left the mini-course, after completing it, you'll be able to find
      your way around a computer pretty well. However, please follow the links
      within a lesson to dive deeper, deepening your knowledge, and enhancing
      your developer experience
    </p>

    <p>Let's get started!</p>
