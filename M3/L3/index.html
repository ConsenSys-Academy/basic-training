    <p>
      This lesson is a list of common commands with an explanation or example
      and a link to more information about them. If you'd like to learn more
      about a certain command, you can see the "More Resources" section in the
      next lesson or you can use the <code>man [COMMAND]</code> command, which
      will open the <b>man</b>ual page on a MacOS or Linux terminal (to exit the
      <code>man</code> page, please type the letter <code>q</code>). You can
      also Google "[COMMAND YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT] terminal command,"
      which hopefully will get you some fruitful results.

    <h2>File and Directory Commands</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>$</code> is the command line prompt and <code>~</code> is stands
        for your home directory (more on
        <a
          href="https://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Wikilearn/TildeSlash"

          >~</a
        >
        here)
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>pwd</code> allows you "to find out the path of the current working
        directory (folder) you’re in. The command will return an absolute (full)
        path, which is basically a path of all the directories that starts with
        a forward slash (/). An example of an absolute path is /home/username."
        (<a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/myquqp/linux_basic_commands_every_user_should_know/"
          target="_blank"
         
          >source</a
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>cd</code> "allow[s] you to change directories. When you open a
        terminal you will be in your home directory. To move around the file
        system you will use cd.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To navigate to your home directory, use
            <code>cd</code> or <code>cd ~</code>;
          </li>
          <li>To navigate up one directory level, use <code>cd ..</code>.</li>
          <li>
            To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, specify
            the full directory path that you want to go to. For example, use:
          </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>cd /var/www</code> to go directly to the
              <code>/www</code> subdirectory of <code>/var/.</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              As another example, <code>cd ~/Desktop</code> will move you to the
              <code>Desktop</code> subdirectory inside your home directory.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>ls</code> "is used to view the contents of a directory. By
        default, this command will display the contents of your current working
        directory. If you want to see the content of other directories, type
        <code>ls</code> and then the directory’s path. For example, enter
        <code>ls /home/username/Documents</code> to view the content of
        <code>Documents</code>. There are variations you can use with the ls
        command:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>ls -R</code> will list all the files in the sub-directories as
            well.
          </li>
          <li><code>ls -a</code> will show the hidden files.</li>
          <li>
            <code>ls -al</code> will list the files and directories with
            detailed information like the permissions, size, owner, etc."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>mkdir</code> "The <code>mkdir</code> command will allow you to
        create directories. Example: <code>mkdir music</code> will create a
        directory called <code>music</code>" Remember, a common multiple command
        line is <code>mkdir NEW_DIRECTORY && cd NEW_DIRECTORY</code>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>clear</code> will clear all typing on the terminal and give you a
        fresh line.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>CONTROL + c</code> will interrupt any terminal process and return
        you to the prompt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>cat</code> "is used to list the contents of a file [...]. To run
        this command, type <code>cat</code> followed by the file’s name and its
        extension. For instance: <code>cat file.txt</code>."
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>cp</code> "cop[ies] files from the current directory to a
        different directory. For instance, the command
        <code>cp scenery.jpg /home/username/Pictures</code> would create a copy
        of <code>scenery.jpg</code> (from your current directory) into the
        <code>Pictures</code> directory."
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>mv</code> "is to [used to] move files, although it can also be
        used to rename files. The arguments in <code>mv</code> are similar to
        the <code>cp</code> command. You need to type <code>mv</code>, the
        file’s name, and the destination’s directory. For example:
        <code>mv file.txt /home/username/Documents</code>. To rename files, the
        command is <code>mv oldname.ext newname.ext</code>"
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Command History</b> to access any commands you've run, simply press
        the "up" arrow on the command line prompt. The terminal will scroll
        through the history of your commands starting from the most recent. To
        execute the command, simply hit <code>enter</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Running an File (Application) within a Directory</h2>
    <li>
      It's possible to run some files from the command line. Typically, these
      files end in an extension like <code>.sh</code>. To run a file, navigate
      to the directory holding the file and use the format:
      <code>$ ./filename.extension</code>. Certain files cannot be run by
      themselves from the command line like this, however. For
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
        target="_blank"
       
        >Python</a
      >
      files, for example, you need to make sure Python is installed and use the
      format <code>$ python python-file-name.py</code>. For JavaScript files,
      you need to
      <a
        href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"
        target="_blank"
       
        >install Node</a
      >
      and run with the format <code>$ node javascriptFile.js</code>
    </li>
    <h2>System Information Commands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>top</code> (<b>t</b>able <b>o</b>f <b>p</b>rocesses) command
        allows you to quickly see the what programs are running on your machine
        and how many resources they are consuming. It's a quick alternative to
        the Activity Monitor in MacOS or Task Manager in Windows. To quit
        <code>top</code>, simply press <code>q</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Networking and Internet Commands</h2>
    <i
      >Note: Always be careful when downloading from the command line. The GUI
      provides safeguards and visual cues to keep you aware of nefarious
      activity, but that might not be the case with your command line. Only
      download from locations you trust and triple-check before running software
      you've downloaded.</i
    >
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Downloading a File</b> to download a file from a specific internet
        address, you use <code>curl ADDRESS_OF_FILE</code> on MacOS and
        <code>wget ADDRESS_OF_FILE</code> on Linux. The file will download to
        the current directory you run the command in. If you need to move the
        file to another directory, use <code>mv</code>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Decompressing / Unarchiving files</b> Software may be "bundled" or
        compressed with <code>tar</code> or <code>zip</code> formats. Use the
        <code>tar</code> and <code>unzip</code> commands to decompress the files
        into your current directory. To learn more, type
        <code>man gunzip</code> or <code>man tar</code> in your terminal.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>A note on <code>sudo</code> and privileges</h2>
    <p>
      In trying out some command line exercises, you may have been confronted
      with a message that looked something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>You do not have sufficient privilege to perform this operation.</pre>


    <p>
      Certain important files are protected from being read or changed by the
      user. However, these permissions can be changed or overridden by putting
      <code>sudo</code> at the beginning of your command.
      <b
        >You must be extremely careful about using this, though, as you can
        accidentally commit serious damage to your computer while operating as
        <code>sudo</code></b
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      You can learn more about privileges and sudo from
      <a

        >this website here.</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>$PATH</h2>
      <p><code>$PATH</code> "is an environment variable on Unix-like 
        operating systems specifying a set of directories 
        where executable programs are located" 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)" 
        target="_blank"></a>(source).</a></p>
      
        <p>$PATH is important because it allows you to run programs
          from your command line without specifying the directory where
        the program is located. For example, you can run <code>$ npm 
        install dependencies</code> without specifying where <code>npm</code> 
        is located because your computer has Node and <code>npm</code> 
        linked on the <code>$PATH</code> variable.</p>

        <p>
          Sometimes you can encounter errors because your <code>$PATH</code> variable 
          is not configured correctly. In that case, you'll have to make changes to the 
          file. To find your $PATH in Linux, please see
