  <h1>Terminal Clients</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>Terminal clients, also called terminal emulators, are ways of making the command line interface easier to work with. They are not necessary and the native terminal clients work great. However, some offer certain features, like autocomplete, as well as color and font customization.</p>
