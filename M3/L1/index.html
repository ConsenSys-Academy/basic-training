    <h1>Graphical User Interface (GUI) vs Command Line Interface (CLI)</h1>

    <p>
      Before we go into the command line, let's talk briefly about difference
      between the

      and

    <p>
      People coming into software from non-technical backgrounds are most
      comfortable with the GUI and its navigation tool, the mouse. The idea of
      limiting oneself to the command line can seem intimidating. The good news
      is you can usually use a GUI <i>and</i> a command line interface — it's
      rare you can only use the command line. So, if the GUI is an option, why
      should we use the command line? Here are a few reasons:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>It can save you time</b> There's a reason you have hundreds of
        keyboard shortcuts and maybe ten on the mouse. The keyboard can create
        more combinations. Also, the command line and keyboard can make certain
        tasks extremely fast and easy, such as downloading and expanding files,
        checking for the existence of a file, or making a new directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>It's good to know how in a pinch</b> In the event of a system crash
        or configuration where the GUI is not available, it's good to know how
        to use the command line.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Scripting repetitive tasks</b> The command line interface can extend
        your power on your computer by automating certain repetitive tasks or
        bypassing obstacles the GUI might put up.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We don't expect you to convert totally to CLI. However, we do think you'll
      be more successful in the course if you feel more comfortable with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this module, we'll go over some basic commands. We'll also find ways of
      customizing your command line. Silly things like changing the color or
      font can actually make you feel more comfortable using the command line.
      And the amount of work you'll be doing on the computer for this course,
      you'll be grateful for it at some point, we promise!

      <p>On a Mac, press the “Command” button and then the space bar, which will pull “Spotlight Search”. Type in Terminal and press Enter.</p>

      <p>On a Ubuntu Linux machine, you can find a launcher for the terminal by clicking on the Activities item at the top left of the screen, then typing the first few letters of “terminal”, “command”, “prompt” or “shell”.
