  <h1>Shortcuts, Remapping, Customization and Aliasing</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>Now that we've got the basics covered, let's start to make things a bit more fun and interesting. Customization can go a long way to making you feel more comfortable and at home on the command line, or at least not quite as dreadful. We'll start by going over some keyboard shortcuts that will improve your quality of life, then talk about remapping your keyboard. Last, we'll give a few options for customizing your terminal emulator.</p>

  <h2>Shortcuts</h2>

  <p>

    Here are some common keyboard shortcuts for the command line:

    <ul>
      <li><b>CTRL + c</b> Interrupts and quits the process currently running. Crucial in stopping terminal line programs</li>
      <li><b>CTRL + e</b> Moves your cursor to the beginning of the line</li>
      <li><b>CTRL + a</b> Moves your cursor to the end of the line</li>
      <li><b>CTRL + l</b> Clears your screen without typing <code>clear</code></li>
      <li><b>CTRL + k</b> Delete from current cursor position to end of the line</li>
      <li><b>CTRL + t (Linux) / Escape + t (Mac)</b> Will swap the two words that appear immediately before the cursor</li>
      <li><b>CTRL + r</b> Search your previous command history, easier than using up or down arrows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more Linux shortcuts, please see <a href="https://dev.to/yashsugandh/keyboard-shortcuts-for-linux-terminal-19ml" target="_blank">this article.</a> For more Mac shortcuts, please see <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/03/10/mac-keyboard-shortcuts-terminal/" target="_blank">this article.</a></p>

  </p>

  <h2>Remapping</h2>

    <p>Remapping is the process of changing one key on your keyboard to be another. For example, you can see in the list above, many of these shortcuts use CTRL. Because of this, a common remapping developers use is making your computer think your "Caps Lock" key is actually CTRL. You can find out how to do that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/194705/how-to-disable-or-reassign-the-caps-lock-key-on-any-operating-system/" target="_blank">here.</a> You use your CTRL key way more often than you do your Caps Lock. How often do you actually use your Caps Lock?</p>

    <p>As you continue to use your terminal, you may find other keys you'd like better access to. Consider remapping them if it makes your life a bit easier.</p>

    <p>Remapping can also be done with shortcuts within your terminal. If you find yourself using a shortcut but strain a bit to hit the keys, consider remapping that shortcut to something easier for your hands.</p>

  <h2>Customization: Color and Font</h2>

    <p>Many terminal clients allow you to customize their color, font, sizing, and layout. This not only is fun, but also can help with readability and eye strain. We'll look at a few options for colors and fonts</p>

    <h3>Colors</h3>
      <p>The best way to change the color of your terminal is to find a good <b>color theme</b>. Color themes are sets of colors with an overall coherence that can be loaded in all at once. As an added bonus, you can replicate a good color theme in both your terminal client and code editor.</p>

      <p>Here are a few ways to change your terminal's color theme:
        <ul>

          <br>
          <li><a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-preferences-profiles-colors.html" target="_blank">Here's how to change your iTerm color scheme</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-bash-terminal-a-step-by-step-guide-with-pictures-80267554cb22/" target="_blank">here's how to customize your Mac terminal</a></li>
          <br>
          <li><a href="https://linuxconfig.org/the-best-linux-terminal-color-schemes-for-2019" target="_blank">Here are some good color themes for Linux</a> and <a href="https://iterm2colorschemes.com/" target="_blank">here are some good iTerm colors</a> that can give inspiration for other terminals as well.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A fun tool is <a href="https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat" target="_blank">the lolcat project,</a> which acts like the <code>cat</code> command, but the output is in rainbow! You have to see it to believe it. See <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/12/speed-up-productivity-with-terminal-aliases/" target="_blank">Sarah Drasner's post</a> about how to incorporate it best.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h3>Fonts</h3>
      <p>Changing fonts on your terminal can be very impactful for readability and strain. There are a lot of options (if you're doing a lot of Git, vim and Python work, you might want to consider Powerline, but it's quite advanced.). We'll link to <a href="https://wesbos.com/programming-fonts" target="_blank">this Wes Bos article</a> which lists fonts good for your terminal. We wouldn't recommend purchasing a font if you're just starting, but play around with some free ones!</p>
      
      <p>Another important aspect of font is size, kern spacing and line height spacing. Again, it's to your own preferences, so experiment and see what you like!</p>


  <h2>Aliases</h2>
  
    <p>Aliases are short commands that the terminal interprets as longer commands. When they're applied to commands you run often, they can save significant time. A very common alias people create is <code>mc DIRECTORY_NAME</code> which the terminal will interpret as <code>mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME && cd DIRECTORY_NAME</code>, essentially creating and navigating to the folder in one command.</p>

    <p>Creating aliases can be tricky, so if you're still figuring out the terminal, feel free to come back to this lesson.</p>

    <p>For those interested, we'd recommend a two step process for developing effective aliases:
      <ol>
        <li>Find what commands you use most frequently. There are a few ways to do this, but, if your history is long enough, the following command may work on a UNIX-like system: <code>history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head</code>. Note: to make this most effective, you typically must increase your history and specify terminal to save history when exiting, otherwise you will only have the commands you've used recently. Please see the next section on <b>Shell Frameworks</b> to see how to do this.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once you've found which commands you use the most, you need to locate the correct file to create your aliases. This is typically a <code>profile</code> or a run command (<code>rc</code>) file but <i>which</i> run command file depends on your shell. If you're using <code>bash</code>, you'll want to create or edit <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code>. If you're using <code>zsh</code>, the default for MacOS 10.15 Catalina and later, you'll want to edit <code>~/.zprofile</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code>. See <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/187639/zsh-not-hitting-profile" target="_blank">this Superuser post</a> for more information on <code>profile</code> and <code>rc</code> files.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  
    <p>Once you've found the command(s) you'd like to create the aliases for and the proper place to put them, you can create an alias using the following syntax options (<a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/bash-aliases-mac-centos-linux-unix.html" target="_blank">taken from this site</a>):</p>

    <pre>
      alias name=value
      alias name='command'
      alias name='command arg1 arg2'
      alias name='/path/to/script'
      alias name='/path/to/script.pl arg1'
    </pre>

    <p>Last, once you've saved your changes to the <code>profile</code> or <code>rc</code> file, you can activate those changes by running (from the command line) <code>$ source ~./YOUR_PROFILE_OR_RC_FILE</code></p>

    <p>To double check your alias has been added, type <code>$ alias</code> to list all available aliases in your terminal</p>

    <h3>Common Commands to Alias</h3>
      <p>Below are some common commands people for which make aliases. It should give you a sense of the goal of aliases and what they look like.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>alias ..='cd ..'</code> You can add on to this, for example <code>alias ...='cd ../..'</code></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/12/speed-up-productivity-with-terminal-aliases/" target="_blank">From Sarah Drasner:</a> <code>alias gi='git add -A && git commit -m'</code>, which allows you to run <code>gi 'your commit message here'</code></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/12/speed-up-productivity-with-terminal-aliases/" target="_blank">From Sarah Drasner:</a> <code>alias gr='grep --color -r'</code>, which searches recursively from your current folder and colorizes output, i.e. <code>gr 'assets'</code></li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Hopefully, this has given you a few ideas on how to start aliasing and customizing in general. Other tips are just an internet search away!
