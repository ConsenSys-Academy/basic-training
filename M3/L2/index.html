  <h1>What is the Command Line Interface (CLI)?</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">command line interface (CLI)</a> is the basic non-graphic interface for your computer. It is sometimes also called the terminal, the shell, or the bash client. In this section, we'll go over some basic concepts.</p>
 
  <h2>Everything is a File</h2>

    <p>An overarching philosophy with command line clients is the concept that <i>Everything is a File.</i> This means that every item you see on the command line interface or terminal is a file that can either be written to (changed) or read. Take a look at the image below:</p>

    <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/terminal-file-1.png" alt="A screenshot of a terminal screen showing files"></div>

    <p>This is a terminal showing the contents of the current user's <b>directory</b> (also known as a folder) using a common command <code>ls</code>. This is the user's "Home" folder and, even though these are more folders, the command line simply sees them as files. We can read these files, or write to / change these files (by adding more documents or changing their name, for example).</p>

    <p>No matter what kind of file the folder holds, the command line will simply understand it as a file. This is a form of <i>abstraction</i> which allows the command line to generalize computation in a powerful way. This concept of command line abstraction is extremely important and you can read more about it in this e-book <a href="https://www.bottomupcs.com/chapter00.xhtml" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

  <h2>Command Line Syntax</h2>
    <p><i>In this section, we'll be borrowing heavily from <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommandlineHowto" target="_blank">the Ubuntu Help website.</a></i></p>

    <p>Please follow along with these examples in your own terminal!</p>

    <h3>The Prompt</h3>
      <p>The prompt shows that you've properly loaded your command line and it's ready to receive instructions. While it looks different on different computers, it is generally portrayed using the structure:</p>

      <pre>USERNAME@COMPUTER_NAME:~ $</pre>

      <p>So if you're name was Jaime and you were on a Ubuntu machine, your prompt would look like:</p>

      <pre>Jaime@ubuntu:~ $ </pre>

      <p>Most important here is the dollar sign <code>$</code> which represents the command line. In tutorials, you may see code that starts with the <code>$</code>. This means that you should copy everything <b>after</b> the <code>$</code> but do not include the <code>$</code>. It is only meant to signify the code given should be executed on the command line.</p>

    <h3>Single Command</h3>
      <p>The most simple command possible on the terminal is the single command. To execute a single command on the terminal, simply type the command and press enter: </p>

      <pre>$ COMMAND</pre>

      <p>We've already seen one example of this, the <code>ls</code> command, which lists all the files in the current directory. Here's another example:</p>

      <pre>$ pwd</pre>

      <p>This command lists the <b>p</b>resent <b>w</b>orking <b>d</b>irectory, or your current location in the computer, also known as your <b>path</b>. See the example below:</p>

      <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/terminal-file-2.png" alt="A screenshot of the command pwd"></div>

      <p>Another form of the single command is this format:</p>

      <pre>$ COMMAND <ARGUMENT></pre>

      <p>In this syntax, <code>COMMAND</code> operates on the <code>ARGUMENT</code>. See the examples below:</p>
      
      <pre>
        user@ubuntu:~ $ echo "Hello World!"
        "Hello World!"
      </pre>

      The command <code>echo</code> prints the argument <code>"Hello World"</code> to the command line output.

      <pre>
        user@ubuntu:~ $ cat file1.txt
        These are the contents
        Of our test file
        Printed on the command line  
      </pre>

      <p>The command <code>cat</code> prints the contents of the argument <code>file1.txt</code> to the command line output.</p>
      
      <p>Here is another common format for command line code:</p>

      <pre>$ command -option</pre>

      <code>-option</code> is a variable we pass to <code>command</code> to alter its behavior. For example, if we run:

      <pre>user@ubuntu:~ $ ls -a</pre>

      <p>This will show <b>a</b>ll the files, including those that are hidden. Compare this terminal screen to the previous <code>ls</code> example above or try it on your own terminal!</p>

      <div class="img-wrapper"><img src="../../img/terminal-file-3.png" alt="screenshot of the command ls -a"></div>

      <p>When <code>option</code> is used in conjunction with running a program from the command line, we call it a <b>flag</b>. 
        
      A common one you'll see in the course is <code>-v</code> or <code>--version</code>, which tells us what version of the program we are running (note the difference in the number of dashes):</p>

      <pre>
        user@ubuntu:~ $ node -v 
        v15.11.0
      </pre>

      <p>When we're troubleshooting issues, this is <b>extremely helpful</b> to know what version of a program we're running.</p>

      <p>It's possible to run a command with five, ten or more <b>flags</b>. When we're working with Ethereum software clients, such as <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Geth</a> or <a href="https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Hyperledger Besu,</a> you will see they sometimes have many flags!</p>

    <h3>Multiple Commands</h3>

      <p>We can also run multiple commands in the same terminal line. We do this by the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">operators</a> such as <code>&&</code>. The format for running multiple commands is:</p>

      <pre>$ command1 && command2</pre>

      <p>A common way this is used is tying together the <code>mkdir</code> (which makes a directory or folder) and <code>cd</code> (which navigates into a directory or folder) commands. See the example below:</p>

      <pre>user@ubuntu:~ $ mkdir test-folder && cd test-folder</pre>

<b>order of the commands</b> is extremely important -- we cannot run <code>cd</code> before <code>mkdir</code> in the example above.</p>

    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    
      <p>One more command line syntax structure before we get to common commands, control flow. This is the ability to redirect the input or output of a command.</p>

      <p>One example of this is the <code>></code> operator, which redirects the output of a command as an argument to the second command. A common way that is used is the following:</p>

      <pre>
        user@ubuntu:~ $ echo "I'm writing to a text file!"> file1.txt
      </pre>

      <p>Here, we're directing the output of the <code>echo</code> command (the text argument we passed in) into the file <code>file1.txt</code>. We don't have to create <code>file1.txt</code> beforehand, the command line will create it for us if it doesn't exist. Warning, if it does exist, it will <b>overwrite</b> existing content. Test to see you've successfully written to <code>file1.txt</code> by running:</p>

      <pre>
        user@ubuntu:~ $ cat file1.txt
        I'm writing to a text file!
      </pre>

      <p>Another control flow operator which redirects content is the pipe or <code>|</code>, located typically on the backslash or <code>\</code> key. It does a similar job to <code>></code> operator but works on different commands. See the example from Ubuntu Help below:</p>

      <pre>user@ubuntu:~ $ ls | sort</pre>

      <p>This command lists all the files in the current directory but also sorts them by their first character. Try it on your command line to see how it works!</p>
