    <h1>Advanced: Shell Frameworks</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      <i
        >This section, while open to all, is meant for advanced users. You do
        not need to complete this lesson if you are new to the command line.</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      In the previous section, we covered customization of the command line,
      including shortcuts and aliases. Hopefully, that showed you the potential
      power lying dormant in your command line and awoke a spirit of
      customization and optimization you'd like to pursue more. Well, you're in
      luck, because people have collected entire command line configuration and
      packaged them into <b>shell frameworks</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shell frameworks are typically community-driven efforts to gather some of
      the most helpful aliases, custom prompts and other customizations into one
      project the user can install. However, people install a shell framework
      and then choose a few customizations they find most helpful. Some users
      may also start on a shell framework but then revert to "vanilla" (no shell
      framework) <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>, keeping some of their
      favorite aliases from the shell framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this lesson, we're going to go over a popular shell framework,
      <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Oh-My-Zsh</a
      >, and a popular custom prompt,
      <a
        href="https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Spaceship</a
      >. We'll then show you a few custom configurations for "vanilla" terminal
      setups, using real-life config files from software engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i
        >Note: Oh-My-Zsh requires your terminal to be running <code>zsh</code>,
        which is not the native terminal language for Linux. However, you can

    <h2>Oh-My-Zsh</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >From the Oh-My-Zsh website:</a
      >
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <i
        >Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing
        your Zsh configuration. Oh My Zsh comes bundled with plugins [and

      </i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You can install Oh-My-Zsh from the terminal using <code>wget</code> or
      <code>curl</code>. Please see install instructions from their website
      <a
        href="https://ohmyz.sh/#install"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"

      or use the following <code>curl</code> command:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"</pre

    </p>

    <p>
      Oh-My-Zsh plugins are sophisticated tools that improve your
      <code>zsh</code> experience. Here are a few popular Oh-My-Zsh plugins:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/autojump"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          ><b>Autojump</b></a
        >
        "is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a
        database of the directories you use the most from the command line."
        Read more about autojump from its page
        <a
          href="https://github.com/wting/autojump"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >here</a
        >
        and find out to install it from its Oh-My-Zsh plugin page
        <a
          href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/autojump"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >here.</a
        >
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          ><b>Syntax Highlighting</b></a
        >
        is a way of differentiating commands from arguments and different
        variables on the command line. It's visually appealing but also helps
        catch errors. This plugin is not bundled with Oh-My-Zsh, but can be
        easily installed following
        <a
          href="https://hackernoon.com/customize-oh-my-zsh-with-syntax-highlighting-and-auto-suggestions-6q1b3w8o"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >these instructions.</a
        >
        Please note plugins are separated by whitespaces, not commas, when
        adding them to <code>/.zshrc</code>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions"

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          ><b>Autosuggestions</b></a
        >
        "suggests commands as you type based on history and completions." See
        more information on their website here. This is also not bundled with
        Oh-My-Zsh. To install it,
        <a
          href="https://hackernoon.com/customize-oh-my-zsh-with-syntax-highlighting-and-auto-suggestions-6q1b3w8o"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >follow these instructions.</a
        >
        Please note plugins are separated by whitespaces, not commas, when
        adding them to <code>/.zshrc</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Oh-My-Zsh also supports roughly 150 color themes natively. See
      <a
        href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >this page</a
      >
      to find a theme you like. To choose a theme, follow these instructions
      from Oh-My-Zsh:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      In order to enable a theme, set <code>ZSH_THEME</code> to the name of the
      theme in your ~/.zshrc, before sourcing Oh My Zsh; for example:
      <code>ZSH_THEME=robbyrussell</code> If you do not want any theme enabled,
      just set <code>ZSH_THEME</code> to blank or remove the line:
      <code>ZSH_THEME=""</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Again, you might find Oh-My-Zsh overkill. That's totally okay! Regardless,
      you may get some aliasing or customization ideas from their plugins and
      themes. For example, check out their
      <a
        href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/common-aliases"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        ><code>common-aliases</code> plugin.</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Spaceship</h2>

    <p>From the website:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i
        >Spaceship is a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable Zsh
        prompt. It combines everything you may need for convenient work, without
        unnecessary complications, like a real spaceship.</i
      >
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      As you can see from the image below, Spaceship targets the
      <b>prompt</b> of the terminal, rather than commands put in the terminal.
      It provides visual cues to help with error handling, git workflow, library
      versions (Node, Ruby, etc.) and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the above screenshot is running on
      <a href="https://hyper.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

      Spaceship may run slow on directories that are git repositories with lots
      of unstaged changes. Read more about what Spaceship provides on

    <h2>Heavy Aliasing</h2>

    <p>
      You may go through the documentation for Oh-My-Zsh and Spaceship and
      decide you'd like to "roll your own" shell framework, so to speak. You can
      definitely do this by setting up configurations and aliases on your own.
      (See the previous section about editing your terminal configuration.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some more simple-but-popular customizations people like to use
      for their terminals:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Extend and Save Your Session History</b> You may try to find your
        most common commands and realize your history only includes the current
        session. For <code>bash</code>,
        <a
          href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50649/how-to-make-bash-terminal-app-remember-history-of-previous-sessions"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >use this SO answer</a
        >
        to configure your history and be sure to force a save in case following
        these instructions
        <a
          href="https://superuser.com/questions/20900/bash-history-loss-when-using-histappend"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >here.</a
        >
        For <code>zsh</code>, you need to add a few lines to your
        <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:
        <pre>
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html
              # ignore duplicates in history
              setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS
              # ignore spaces in history
              setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE
              #append into history file
              setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY
              #set history size
              export HISTSIZE=50000
              #save history after logout
              export SAVEHIST=10000
              #history file
              export HISTFILE=~/.zhistory
              # Add timestamp to history
              export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S "</pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        You can remove the pesky "last login" line at the top of your
        <code>zsh</code> sessions on MacOS by simply running
        <code>$ touch .hushlogin</code> and restarting your terminal.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There are so many more options for customizing your shell experience. A
      great icebreaker online is to ask engineers to share their favorite
      terminal aliases. Some might even be generous enough to share their config
      file! You can also look to
      <a
        href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/common-aliases"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >the <code>common-aliases</code> plugin</a
      >
      to get ideas (for <code>bash</code> as well!)
    </p>
