    <p>Below are great places to start learning Javascript. It's very rare that one resource will be able to teach you everything, so check out a number of the resources below and don't feel like you have to stick with any of them. If there are resources you really like that are not here, please let us know by <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys-Academy/basic-training/edit/main/M6-javascript/L3/index.html" target="_blank">editing this page.</a></p>

  <p>You may find the Javascript quiz for this course challenging. That's by design, as we want to make sure people taking our <a href="https://courses.consensys.net/" target="_blank">Blockchain Developer Bootcamp</a> have a strong understanding of Javascript. If so, please check out the first three links for online courses where you can learn more about Javascript.</p>
