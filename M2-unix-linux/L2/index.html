    <h1>Package Managers</h1>
    <h2>What are they?</h2>
    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      The operating system, be it Unix or Linux, is the very basic software
      needed to run a computer. But we'd like to do more interesting things than
      just type or use the basic software, right? This is where package managers
      come in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Package managers "automate the process of installing, upgrading,
      configuring and removing computer [software] for a computer's operating
      system" (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager"
        target="_blank"
        >source</a
      >). Installing software involves a host whole of operations, including
      finding the proper source, making sure the computer can run the software,
      creating directories for the software to store information, keeping the
      software up to date, and, if desired, removing the software completely
      from the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Linux comes with multiples variations which we call distros. One of the most popular one is Ubuntu which we will use throughout the course.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Ubuntu Linux's package manager <code>APT</code> is good and we'll learn about it
      below, but MacOS' does not have a native package manager installed. We'll
      go over how to install a third-party package manager for Mac called
      Homebrew. Please note that other ditros might have different package manager like yum for RedHat & Fedora.
    </p>

    <h2>Advanced Package Tool (APT)</h2>

    <p>
      Since Linux is open-source, it has a free package manager called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)" target="_blank"
        >APT</a
      >
      better recognized from its common command <code>apt-get</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since it is shipped natively with Linux, you do not have to install it. If
      you would like to learn more about APT, you can read about it on
      Ubuntu.com
      <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/" target="_blank"
        >here.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The command line section is next, but a preview here: To run APT on your
      machine, you typically have to use the <code>sudo</code> command. To learn
      more about sudo,

    <h2>Mac's Package Manager: Homebrew</h2>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, MacOS does not come with a native package manager. If
      you're not comfortable with the command line yet, please go through the
      next module and install Homebrew when you're comfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)"
        target="_blank"
        >Homebrew</a
      >
      is a popular, open-source package manager for MacOS and Linux, but it's
      mainly used on MacOS. Homebrew is written in
      <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/" target="_blank"
        >Ruby</a
      >
      and can be installed from the command line. You can either visit
      <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">the Homebrew website</a> or
      simply paste this into your terminal:
    </p>

    <pre style="word-wrap: break-word">
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre
    >
