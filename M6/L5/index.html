    <h2>What is a Framework?</h2>
      <p>
        A Javascript framework is a collection of services 
        that allow for a standard way to build websites 
        encompassing database creation, HTML / CSS templating 
        and session management. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework" target="_blank">source</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        Frameworks arose from the need of dynamic websites, 
        like Facebook and Google. These websites push the 
        limits of HTML with the amount of user interaction 
        and data refreshing they needed to do for a typical 
        session. Javascript frameworks, also sometimes called 
        web frameworks, optimized web performance by building 
        extensive and specialized software in Javascript to 
        be injected into a website and refresh itself based 
        on a user’s actions.

      <p>
        The most popular frameworks are <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js,</a> <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular.js</a> 
        (maintained by Google) and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> (maintained by 
        Facebook) (though React is technically a library, 
        not a framework). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript-based_web_frameworks" target="_blank">
        Here’s a list of other popular Javascript frameworks.
        </a> 
      </p>

    <h2>Why Are They Popular?</h2>
      <p>
        Javascript frameworks are popular because they can 
        allow for a developer to quickly develop a sophisticated 
        web application. <b> Be warned about Javascript frameworks,
        however:</b> While they can provide an initial website very 
        quickly, it can be very difficult to alter a website if 
        you’re not familiar with the framework or not comfortable 
        with Javascript. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth" target="_blank">Scaffold-eth</a> is a great Javascript framework for Ethereum 
        developers as it’s written using React.js and Hardhat. However, note 
        the above warning about the difficulties of altering React.js application if you’re not comfortable!
      </p>

          <li><a href="https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app" target="_blank">Create-eth-app</a>, a variation of the very popular create-react-app setup command for React projects</li>
        </ul>
