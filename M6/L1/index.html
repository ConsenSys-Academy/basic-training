  <h2>The "Just Enough" Language</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a> is a programming language used by 97% of websites on the internet. It is a core Web technology, alongside HTML and CSS, which has given rise to its dominance. All major browsers can run Javascript. (Contrary to its name, its not related to Java.)</p>

    <p>For a long time, Javascript had the reputation of a scrappy language. This is for a number of reasons. First, despite it being used widely in every web company, Javascript was not standardized. The way it ran in one browser might not be the same in another. As a result, Javascript gained a reputation for being confusing and disorganized.</p>

    <p>In 2015, after years of failing to agree to a standard definition of Javascript, major developers released a standard for Javascript called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" target="_blank">ECMAScript 6.</a> Since then, the Javascript community has become more unified and strong. A good thing, too, as Javascript, as a computer language, has become incredibly common and powerful.</p>

    <p>Another aspect of Javascript contributing to its reputation as a scrappy language is that many people would only learn "just enough" Javascript to solve the immediate problem at hand. It was unusual to sit down and learn Javascript as you would learn another language like C or Python. Developers might feel as though they only have snatches of knowledge, but lack a proper, comprehensive view of Javascript.</p>

    <p>These two trends led to Javascript having a reputation of immaturity in the software development community until the standardization of ECMAScript 6.</p>

  <h2>Javascript Eats the World</h2>
    <p>Despite this, Javascript has become critical to everyone's experience of the internet since the mid-1990s. Javascript gave an interactivity and vitality to websites and moved the browser experience away from visiting static documents to users being able to interact with websites like applications.</p>

    <p>That has only grown as social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter ("Web 2.0") introduced even more activity to the web browser. As we'll see in the next module, this has led to an enormous development in the way we understand data today.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to know more about Javascript and the rise of new data structures, please read this article, <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/want-to-really-understand-blockchain-you-need-to-understand-state/" target="_blank"><i>"The Battle for State"</i></a></p>

    <p>This module will be some material to help you understand what Javascript is, but it will mainly be links to resources where you can properly learn Javascript. That's beyond the scope of this introductory course and has been handled very well by the sites we'll share at the end of this module!</p>

    <p>What we hope to provide is some context around Javascript and the main differences between Javascript and Python, as these are the two languages most recommended to beginners.</p>
