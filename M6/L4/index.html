  <h1>Node</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      Node.js, but often shortened to Node, was built by Ryan Dahl 
      in 2009. It is an 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank">
        “open-source, cross-platform, back-end
        JavaScript runtime environment that [...] executes
        JavaScript code outside a web browser.”
      </a> This means that Javascript, once meant only 
      for websites, could now also be used to program servers 
      and other functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until Node, Javascript had mainly been a “front-end” 
      language, used to build websites that faced users, but 
      not the back-end databases that supply those websites with info. With Node, the impact of Javascript has dramatically expanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Node also provides a really powerful package (similar to 
      library or module) manager, <code>npm</code> (Node Package Manager). 
      <code>npm</code> is a command line tool that allows you to install packages and dependencies for Javascript projects. These packages 
      are developed by third-party developers and can be found on 
      <a href="http://www.npmjs.com" target="_blank">npmjs.com</a>. There are over a million packages listed on 
      the site!
    </p>

    <h3>yarn</h3>
      <p>Another common package manager you may see, other than <code>npm</code>, 
      is called <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">
      yarn</a> 
      and was developed by Facebook, although it's now open-source. 
      Yarn was developed to address security and speed issues with 
      <code>npm</code> (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-npm-and-yarn/" target="_blank">
      source</a>).</p>

      <p>Overall, they have similar command structures and they both 
        play the same role handling dependencies. </p>

    <h2>Installing Node</h2>
      <h3>Mac</h3>  
        <p>To install Node and npm on Mac, be sure to install Homebrew. To install Homebrew:
        </p>

        <p>You can either visit <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">the Homebrew website</a> or simply paste this into your terminal:</p> 

        <pre style="word-wrap: break-word;">$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre>
      
        <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation" target="_blank">the Installation page</a> from Homebrew</p>

        <p>Once Homebrew is installed, install Node and npm by running:</p>

        <pre>$ brew install node</pre>

      <h3>Linux</h3>

        <p>To install Node and npm on Ubuntu, run the following commands:</p>

        <pre>$ sudo apt install nodejs && sudo apt install npm</pre>
