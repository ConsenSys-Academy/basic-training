  <h1>Javascript vs Python</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>When people want to learn to program, people recommend either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python.</a> Indeed, we’ll be providing material for Python programmers in our Bootcamp, as the Ethereum world supports <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/#vyper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vyper,</a> a Pythonic smart contract language. However, we wanted to explain some of the similarities and differences you might find between the two languages as well as why we are emphasizing Javascript for the Bootcamp.</p>

    <h2>Similarities</h2>

      <p>Beyond some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">syntactic</a> similarities, Javascript and Python have three things in common:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Lots of learning material for both languages.</b> There are so many great, introductory courses available for free online for both Javascript and Python.</li>
        <li><b>Eager Communities</b> Both the Javascript and Python have eager, growing and vibrant communities that welcome beginners and host conferences and talks you can find online or perhaps nearby in-person.</li>
        <li><b>Active Development</b> Both Javascript and Python are dynamic languages, with new developments, optimizations and innovations occurring all the time. There will always be something new to learn!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let's go over some of the differences the languages have.</p>

    <h2>Differences: Use Cases (sort of)</h2>

      <p>Python has a reputation for being used in more academic settings. For example, Python is typically used before Javascript for data processing, visualization and machine learning. However, Python is not just used for data crunching, there are plenty of folks who use Python for web develompent and, as we mentioned, a Pythonic language is used in some <a href="https://yearn.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major DeFi applications</a> on Ethereum.</p>

      <p>Javascript has a reputation for being used more with web development, as we mentioned previously. This has to do with the speed of Javascript vs Python -- Python runs a bit slower, with more capacity for data visualization, while Javascript can be packaged to run very quickly in the browser.</p>

    <h2>Differences: Modules</h2>

      <p>A module, sometimes called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">library</a>, is a discrete piece of software developed to assist in a specific task that a language might not be able to do on its own. An analogy might be a browser extension's relationship to a browser: the extension needs to be installed by was developed by a third-party to extend the capacity of the browser</p>

      <p>Modules can be extremely helpful, particularly when learning how to program. Python incorporates a wide variety of modules while Javascript has <a href="https://www.guru99.com/python-vs-javascript.html#7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less modules</a> available. (Node.js does provide modules for Javascript, but it's not provided natively and requires setup)</p>
    
    <h2>Differences: REPL</h2>
      
      <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REPL</a> is an interactive computing environment, similar to a command line, that takes in user input and executes them against a language. REPLs are for specific languages, and they help troubleshoot or provide some realtime experience.</p>

      <p>Python has a native REPL client that can be run from your command line once Python has been installed. Javascript does not have a native REPL client, but because all major web browsers run Javascript, you can <a href="https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a REPL on your browser.</a> Node.js also provides a REPL client, but, again, it's not native to Javascript and requires setup.</p>

    <h2>Uniformity</h2>
      <p>As we mentioned earlier, before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECMAScript 6,</a> Javascript had some issues with uniformity. However, since then, it's been completely standardized and uniform.</p>

      <p>Python also had a resolved issue with uniformity, which was the division of Python into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python 2 and Python 3.</a> Python 3 was released in December 2008 and was backward-incompatible, meaning any software built with Python 3 could not run on Python 2 and vice versa. However, Python 2 was discontinued in 2020 and there is now only Python 3. </p>
        
      <p>You may still see some older tutorials refer to Python 2 or Python 3. An easy, quick way to tell if a tutorial is written using Python 2 is the <code>print</code> statement, Python 3 will only accept <code>print("string here")</code>, while Python 2 can accept <code>print</code> with no parenthesis (<code>print "string here"</code>).</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>With the explosion of web development and web frameworks, Javascript has become a powerful universal software language. However, some new learners may find it more intimidating and opinionated to deal with. It's not a stretch to say that Python is actually the more approachable and readable language and therefore is easier for learning. However, Javascript is the heart of the extremely powerful developments happening at the cutting edge of software.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the choice doesn't matter because if you become a software engineer or programmer, you'll have to know both. Whichever you choose will simply be the gateway to learning about computer programming generally, development environments, and how to build software.</p> 
      
    <p>The real question you should ask is: <b>Which language do you feel you'll have a better chance of learning?</b> Have you found a free online course you really like in Python? Does your friend know Javascript and will teach you? Is there a great project online you want to understand better written in Javascript or Python? </p>
