    <h1>Javascript vs Python</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      When people want to learn to program, people recommend either
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
        target="_blank"
       
        >Javascript</a
      >
      or
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
        target="_blank"
       
        >Python.</a
      >
      Indeed, weâ€™ll be providing material for Python programmers in our
      Bootcamp, as the Ethereum world supports
      <a
        href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/#vyper"
        target="_blank"
       
        >Vyper,</a
      >
      a Pythonic smart contract language. However, we wanted to explain some of
      the similarities and differences you might find between the two languages
      as well as why we are emphasizing Javascript for the Bootcamp.
    </p>

    <h2>Similarities</h2>

    <p>
      Beyond some
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)"
        target="_blank"
       
        >syntactic</a
      >
      similarities, Javascript and Python have three things in common:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Lots of learning material for both languages.</b> There are so many
        great, introductory courses available for free online for both
        Javascript and Python.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eager Communities</b> Both the Javascript and Python have eager,
        growing and vibrant communities that welcome beginners and host
        conferences and talks you can find online or perhaps nearby in-person.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Active Development</b> Both Javascript and Python are dynamic
        languages, with new developments, optimizations and innovations
        occurring all the time. There will always be something new to learn!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's go over some of the differences the languages have.</p>

    <h2>Differences: Use Cases (sort of)</h2>

    <p>
      Python has a reputation for being used in more academic settings. For
      example, Python is typically used before Javascript for data processing,
      visualization and machine learning. However, Python is not just used for
      data crunching, there are plenty of folks who use Python for web
      develompent and, as we mentioned, a Pythonic language is used in some
      <a href="https://yearn.finance/" target="_blank"
        >major DeFi applications</a
      >
      on Ethereum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Javascript has a reputation for being used more with web development, as
      we mentioned previously. This has to do with the speed of Javascript vs
      Python -- Python runs a bit slower, with more capacity for data
      visualization, while Javascript can be packaged to run very quickly in the
      browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Differences: Modules</h2>

    <p>
      A module, sometimes called a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)"
        target="_blank"
       
        >library</a
      >, is a discrete piece of software developed to assist in a specific task
      that a language might not be able to do on its own. An analogy might be a
      browser extension's relationship to a browser: the extension needs to be
      installed by was developed by a third-party to extend the capacity of the
      browser
    </p>

    <p>
      Modules can be extremely helpful, particularly when learning how to
      program. Python incorporates a wide variety of modules while Javascript
      has
      <a
        href="https://www.guru99.com/python-vs-javascript.html#7"
        target="_blank"
       
        >less modules</a
      >
      available. (Node.js does provide modules for Javascript, but it's not
      provided natively and requires setup)
    </p>

    <h2>Differences: REPL</h2>

    <p>
      A
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop"
        target="_blank"
       
        >REPL</a
      >
      is an interactive computing environment, similar to a command line, that
      takes in user input and executes them against a language. REPLs are for
      specific languages, and they help troubleshoot or provide some realtime
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python has a native REPL client that can be run from your command line
      once Python has been installed. Javascript does not have a native REPL
      client, but because all major web browsers run Javascript, you can
      <a
        href="https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole"
        target="_blank"
       
        >find a REPL on your browser.</a
      >
      Node.js also provides a REPL client, but, again, it's not native to
      Javascript and requires setup.
    </p>

    <h2>Uniformity</h2>
    <p>
      As we mentioned earlier, before
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2015"
        target="_blank"
       
        >ECMAScript 6,</a
      >
      Javascript had some issues with uniformity. However, since then, it's been
      completely standardized and uniform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python also had a resolved issue with uniformity, which was the division
      of Python into
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility"
        target="_blank"
       
        >Python 2 and Python 3.</a
      >
      Python 3 was released in December 2008 and was backward-incompatible,
      meaning any software built with Python 3 could not run on Python 2 and
      vice versa. However, Python 2 was discontinued in 2020 and there is now
      only Python 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may still see some older tutorials refer to Python 2 or Python 3. An
      easy, quick way to tell if a tutorial is written using Python 2 is the
      <code>print</code> statement, Python 3 will only accept
      <code>print("string here")</code>, while Python 2 can accept
      <code>print</code> with no parenthesis (<code>print "string here"</code>).
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>
      With the explosion of web development and web frameworks, Javascript has
      become a powerful universal software language. However, some new learners
      may find it more intimidating and opinionated to deal with. It's not a
      stretch to say that Python is actually the more approachable and readable
      language and therefore is easier for learning. However, Javascript is the
      heart of the extremely powerful developments happening at the cutting edge
      of software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the choice doesn't matter because if you become a software
      engineer or programmer, you'll have to know both. Whichever you choose
      will simply be the gateway to learning about computer programming
      generally, development environments, and how to build software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real question you should ask is:
      <b>Which language do you feel you'll have a better chance of learning?</b>
      Have you found a free online course you really like in Python? Does your
      friend know Javascript and will teach you? Is there a great project online
      you want to understand better written in Javascript or Python?
