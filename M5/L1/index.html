    <h1>What is Git?</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank">Git</a> is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">version-control system (VCS)</a>
      used to track changes made to projects. While Git seems simple, it's
      actually a bit challenging to get comfortable with. (Note that Git is a
      piece of software, on which version control sites like Github, Gitlab and
      others are based.)
    </p>

    <h2>Why is It Used?</h2>
    <p>
      Git was developed to allow multiple people to work on a project
      simultaneously without problems or complications. It was originally
      authored by
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116175401/https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290"
        target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>, creating of Linux, as a way to manage all the contributors to the Linux
      kernel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Git is an impressive bit of software, allowing distributed maintenance of
      a project repository with every computer with a git repository holding a
      full project history, even without a central server or network access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Git has become incredibly common version-control system, employed on the
      popular developer sites Github and Gitlab. Despite it being so prevalent,
      Git can be intimidating to learn. We hope to make it a little easier!
      Let's start with a definition of common Git terms.

    <h3>Common Git Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories"
          target="_blank"><b>Repository</b></a>
        A Git repository holds all the files for your Git project as well as a
        history of all changes made to that project, starting from its creation.
        It is the basic unit of Git: all other actions are defined by how they
        change or do not change the repository. It looks a lot like a normal
        project directory, except it has a folder titled <code>.git</code>.
        Repository is frequently shortened to "repo".
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/about-commits"
          target="_blank"><b></b>Commits</a>
        In Git, commits signfies changes to a Git repository. It's similar to
        the "save" function on your computer. It takes a current snapshot of all
        the changes and creates a checkpoint. A Git commit includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Changes to the repository</li>
          <li>When the changes were snapshotted</li>
          <li>Who authored the changes</li>
          <li>How the author describes the changes</li>
        </ul>

        A commit is not used as frequently as you save your work locally.
        Instead, a commit is meant to represent a certain amount of work done on
        a project. In the commit message, you would then describe what that
        certain amount of work accomplished.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/remote" target="_blank"><b>Remote</b></a>
        Even though Git specializes in being a
        <i>distributed</i> version-control system, there is typically a central,
        common repository that all folks working on a project agree to keep
        updated with the changes, or <b>commits</b>, they're making to the
        repository on their machine. This central, common repository can be on a
        server at work or the public Github page of a project. In Git, we call
        this repository the remote repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push" target="_blank">Push</a></b>
        /
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull" target="_blank"><b>Pull</b></a>
        The process of updating the central, or <b>remote</b>, repository with
        your commits is knowing as <b>pushing</b> your commits. Conversely, when
        you want to get the commits other folks have pushed to the remote
        repository, you <b>pull</b> those commits. Others on your project cannot
        see your changes until you've pushed your commit to remote. Pushing is
        for uploading your commits to the remote repository, pulling is for
        downloading others commits to the remote repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches" target="_blank"><b>Branch</b></a>
        A branch is an independent line of commits (changes) on a repository.
        Branches are usually created when you're conducting long-term
        development, such as building a major feature or upgrade or fixing a
        major bug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/git-origin-master" target="_blank"><b>Main</b></a>
        is the default branch for development in a repository. It was previously
        called "master" but
        <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/" target="_blank">renamed in 2020.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge" target="_blank"><b>Merge</b></a>
        is combining of two separate branches of development. It joins together
        not only the files in the codebases, but also the commit history of the
        two separate branches.
      </li>

        <a href="https://code.likeagirl.io/how-to-undo-the-last-commit-393e7db2840b" target="_blank"><b>Rolling Back a
            Commit</b></a>
        Git allows you to develop without worries because you can't ever truly
        break code. If something breaks with a commit you've done, you can
        simply "roll back" the branch to before the offending commit. This is
        also known as <b>resetting</b>, <b>reverting</b> or <b>returning</b> to
        a previous commit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone"
          target="_blank"><b>Clone</b></a>
        Cloning is the act of copying a desired repository to your computer.
        It's a quick way to download an entire project. Note that
        <code>git clone</code> will only copy the repository, you still have to
        <code>cd</code> into the repository's directory if you're on the command
        line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"
          target="_blank"><b>Pull Request</b></a>
        A pull request is when a contributor asks to merge a branch of
        development with another branch. This involves the maintainers of the
        second branch to review and comment on the contributor's code.
        Sometimes, a pull request is approved and the contributor's branch is
        <b>merged</b> into the other branch. A pull request typically contains
        the files to be changed if the two branches were to merge, description
        of what those changes are / accomplish, and a forum of some sort for the
        different parties to discuss the pull request. A pull request is not a
        part of the core Git software, but rather is a feature of Git services
        like Github or Gitlab.
