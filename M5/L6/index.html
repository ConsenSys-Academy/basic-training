  <h1>Advanced: Pull Requests, Rebasing and Guidelines: Contributing to Open Source</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>Git is great to know for software development generally, but it's also used by many <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source" target="_blank">open-source projects.</a> An essential part of the learning how to code is working on actual projects and codebases and a great way to do that is contributing to open-source projects. Before you jump in feet first into a project and start hacking away it's really important to know some basic guidelines for contributing to open-source.</p>

    <h2>Pull Requests</h2>
    
    <p>We mentioned <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank">pull requests</a> briefly in the first section of this module, but to recap: A pull request is when a contributor asks to merge a branch of development with another branch. This involves the maintainers of the second branch to review and comment on the contributor's code. Sometimes, a pull request is approved and the contributor's branch is merged into the other branch. A pull request typically contains the files to be changed if the two branches were to merge, description of what those changes are / accomplish, and a forum of some sort for the different parties to discuss the pull request. Remember, a pull request is not a part of the core Git software, but rather is a feature of Git services like Github or Gitlab.</p>

    <p>Pull requests are a big part of collaborating on Github and other Git services. </p>

  </ul>
    


    <h2>Rebasing</h2>
      <p>In the process of a pull request, you might realize something in your branch is wrong. The process of undoing, fixing or removing commits is called <b>rebasing</b>. It's best practice to change a Git project by another commit, rather than trying to rework a previous commit. However, sometimes it can't be avoided. Here are some resources to help in those times:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html" target="_blank">Undoing, Fixing, or Removing Commits in Git</a> A "Git Choose-Your-Own-Adventure," this is a nice, simple site that asks questions about your rebasing situation and recommends a solution.</li>
        <li><a href="https://dangitgit.com/en" target="_blank">Dang it, Git!</a> A less profane version of a popular Git troubleshooting guide.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/" target="_blank">How to Undo (Almost) Anything with Git</a> Lays out a series of scenarios and suggests ways of undoing the error.</li>
      </ul>


    <h2>Contributor Guidelines</h2>
      
      <p>Developers need to be aware of the different requirements for community guidelines. Good first steps are: 
        <ul>
          <li>Join the <a href="http://www.discord.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> or <a href="https://gitter.im/" target="_blank">Gitter</a> for the repository, project or team</li> 
          <li>Ask for guidance to good first issues if they’re not properly marked</li>
          <li>Read up on community contributor guidelines. For example, here is Go-Ethereum's <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/devguide" target="_blank">Community Contributor page</a> and their <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/code-review-guidelines" target="_blank">Code Review Guidelines</a></li> 
          <li>Read through open <i>and</i> closed Pull Requests. In the Pull Request section, you can find all Pull Requests. Click through a few and see if you can  understand how the project processes Pull Requests.</li></ul></p>
