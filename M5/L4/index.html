    <h1>GUI Git Clients</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      We didn't want to mention this earlier, but there are GUI clients for
      working with Git projects. Some folks find this easier than the command
      line, particularly if they're visual learners or more comfortable with
      GUIs. Here's a list of popular GUI clients:
    </p>

    <h2>Free</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a>
        a free, open-source project from the Git behemoth. It's a simple
        interface that allows you to visualize commits or commit with others.
        Github Desktop can also be integrated in with editors, if you'd like.
        Read more about Github Desktop
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/desktop" target="_blank">here.</a>

      </div>
      <li>
        <a href="https://gitextensions.github.io/" target="_blank">Git Extensions</a>
        a free, standalone Git GUI client that runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.
        Allows for viewing commits, file history, diffs, etc! Read more about

      </div>
      <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui" target="_blank">git-gui</a>
        is a simple, open-source Git GUI that can run on Unix-like systems and
        Windows. It's relatively lightweight, allowing for making changes to
        repositories and file annotation, but does not provide a project
        history.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://fork.dev/" target="_blank">Fork</a>
        is a fast Git GUI client for Mac and Windows. It allows for all Git
        activity, as well as interactive rebases. Fork can display all the
        commands that run behind a Git action from the GUI, so you can start
        with this GUI, then learn and switch to command line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html" target="_blank">IntelliJ's IDEA Git
          Integration</a>
        We mentioned IDEA as a visual code editor in the previous module, but
        IDEA also has an excellent Git integration that allows for credential
        caching and all manner of Git actions.
      </li>
    </ul>
